As pioneers of pasture-raised farming, Vital Farms already follows incredibly high standards, and these tenets take those existing standards to the next level for this new offering.  Vital Farms is working with Regen Ag Lab to track key measurements like biodiversity and water retention every quarter on the initial farms. Those measurements are being used to determine year-over-year soil health improvements which will be reported annually. Additional progress highlights are updated on the Vital Farms website. Vital Farms tries to be as transparent as possible about how every product gets to the table. Regenerative farming is a growing and evolving practice that the brand is learning alongside the farms and farmers it works with. Vital Farms is committed to raising farm standards by exploring emerging practices and creating scalable solutions for them. Currently, we’re pursuing a third-party regenerative certification for the Restorative carton and, in the coming years, aim to scale regenerative practices throughout our network of over 300 family farms. Twenty-five percent of the home-compostable, green-hued Restorative carton is made from natural grasses like ryegrass fibers, a cover crop sourced from nature reserves.

1|0|NULL|CA|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|This brand is a private label, or store brand. Grocers or distributors will buy their eggs wholesale and re-label them under their own brand name. They often have no direct interaction with the farmers. Store brands lack transparency, often cloaking their practices under the heading of “confidential business information.” Unfortunately, there is an inherent limitation in private‐label organic products. Organic consumers want to know where their food is coming from and how it is produced, and private‐label products are anonymous by their very nature. Our research indicates that the vast majority of organic eggs under private labels brands are produced on industrial farms, where hundreds of thousands of birds are housed without meaningful outdoor access. If you are consumer of this brand we encourage you to reach out and ask where your particular store sources their eggs. While the sourcing may differ across regions, consumer activism plays a valuable role in marketplace transparency.|Gelson's Market^_
