Established in 2005, Eight Mile Creek Farm sits upon 223 acres (plus 120 acres leased for hay production) tucked away on a dirt road in Westerlo, NY in the Heldeberg Hilltowns. The house and barns were originally built in 1835. From that time until the 1950’s it was a working family farm, transitioning into low-scale agricultural production for hay in the mid-1950’s. Pam set out to restore the land as a productive working farm in 2005 by building a diversified agricultural business. She has obtained, and maintains, the farm’s annual organic certification, providing customers with the healthiest products available. Additionally, Pam works hard to protect and nurture the natural resources that their farm depends on for survival. She raises certified organic grass-fed beef, pork, chicken and pastured eggs year-round and the animals receive no growth hormones, antibiotics or medications.” This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Eight Mile Creek Farm^_

We do not believe in use of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics for promotion of growth, and similar pollution of our food. Synthetic fertilizers provide a “quick fix” for growth of plants, but damage the soil in the long term. There are many natural ways to build up soil so that its productivity is on part with or is close to that of industrial growth methods that use synthetic chemicals extensively. Antibiotics for treatment of manifest illness is of course the humane course, but animals so treated cannot then be passed on to our customers. We believe that illness in the animals and plants will be minimized by providing a healthy, natural environment for them.” This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Leafy Creek Farm^_

5|1080|Retail cuts, ground, whole, half|Locally in WI, farm store, online|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Yes|They write: “Here, cows graze on perennial pastures of clover, grasses and other plants. They are rotationally grazed, which means that they are given full, fresh pasture every day in blocks. This promotes the best health for the pasture and the cattle. The bacteria in a cow’s gut is adapted to break down the cellulose in green plants. If fed grains (like corn, fed to 97% of the cows out there), a large part of the normal bacteria die and have to be slowly replaced with ones that are unnatural to them. This in turn negatively affects the cow’s health. Grain also has a much higher percentage of Omega 6 fatty acids than pasture, which is high in Omega-3s, a good fat that Americans are lacking in their heavy grain diet. Most Americans eat both starch heavy and meat heavy diets with very few fresh fruits and veggies. Think about it, a processed diet double doses on the grain, both a direct dose, and the one that we get through the grain eating animal that is the meat.” This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Full Circle Community Farm^_

It all starts with the soil. When we purchased the land over 8 years ago, we not only spent 3 years working on the land and soil to convert it to organic, but also to make sure the soil was at its strongest and healthiest to plant grasses for our future cattle. Once we started planting, our grasses took off and have become healthy pastures that are cows now enjoy. They say as a grass fed beef farmer, you really are a “grass management” farmer, and we agree to that completely. By managing your soil and our grasses to the healthiest and fullest potential, you get healthy, well developed cows that will translate into delicious, nutritious, top quality beef.
