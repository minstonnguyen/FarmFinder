Poultry is an integral part of our operation. The chickens rotate through the fields with the cows and horses and through the vegetable fields post harvest. They pick up insects, provide fertilizer and produce healthy food for people. Although they rely on us, we rely on them as well: as an important contributor to our regenerative farm.” This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Eight Mile Creek Farm^_

Roughly two miles outside the small town of Etna, the ranch is on 100 acres of woodland and pasture—the ideal setting for students to retreat from the distractions of a modern world and step into a rugged experience in nature. Farm life is central to the program. The daily rhythms of the farm foster responsibility and compassion. Students experience a rare physical connection to life and land that is both deeply challenging and highly redemptive. Students take part in growing and raising their own food, cutting and burning their own heat, and identifying and solving a host of problems that come with living so close to the land and to one another.

5|1670|Chicken|Vermont|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Full Moon Farm Inc. is a ROP (Real Organic Project) and VOF (Vermont Organic Farmers)-certified, successful, organic farm, run by us, the husband and wife team of David Zuckerman and Rachel Nevitt. In 1999, David started Full Moon Farm in Burlington’s Intervale, shortly before meeting his farming-loving, future wife, Rachel, who joined him in 2000. They outgrew the Intervale Center Farm Incubation program in 2008 and found new land, new opportunities and new dreams, down the road in Hinesburg. Located in Hinesburg since 2008, Full Moon Farm grows 25 acres of diversified organic vegetables and raises certified organic pigs, chickens, eggs, flowers and CBD, which we sell through our CSA and theBurlington Farmers Markets. We believe we are the only farm in Chittenden county who offers all these items grown or raised organically right here on our own farm. Now in our twenty-second year of farming together, our farm has continued to evolve with the changing times and needs of our customers. Farming with outbuildings and plenty of space in Hinesburg has allowed us to add animals: pigs, angora rabbits, laying hens, and meat birds to our operation. Our large barn lofts allow us to dry onions, garlic and CBD on a much larger scale. Our new pavilion provides space and scenery for pick-ups and on-farm events. Best of all, our big love of our community, helps us share the wealth of good food with our community. This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Full Moon Farm^_

This relationship did not affect our process in reviewing and investigating this brand. Greener Pasture’s says about their chicken: “Living an outdoor lifestyle, our chickens have full access to sunshine and fresh air, bugs and critters they find in the pasture, and native plants and grasses that stretch across their home pasture. Their diet is varied and nutrient-dense. Chickens raised on pasture still require additional feed to supplement their natural foraging, so we source only the freshest and highest-quality USDA Certified Organic feeds. Our organic regenerative farm integrates sustainable practices, encourages biodiversity, and builds healthy soils. Our style of farming is completely nature-driven.” This farm is certified by theReal Organic Project: |Greener Pastures Chicken^_

4|1240|Chicken, processed meat|Nationwide|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|They say: “Bell & Evans’ World’s First Organic Certified, Animal-Welfare-Focused Hatchery where 100% of its broiler chickens hatch is a complete departure from traditional poultry hatcheries. The Hatchery is certified organic by Pennsylvania Certified Organic (PCO), a certification process that Bell & Evans helped to define because it did not previously exist. Here, they’ve replaced standard sanitation processes using harmful chemicals like formaldehyde with stringent biosecurity procedures and organic sanitation methods. Bell & Evans was the first chicken producer to remove the use of antibiotics from 100% of its production more than 20 years ago, but it’s worth noting again that no antibiotics are administered into the eggs or chicks. The most important difference of this Hatchery is that chicks enjoy U.S. grown organic feed, fresh water, and light as soon as they hatch from the egg. In traditional poultry practices, chicks are forced to wait until they’ve arrived at the farm to eat and drink—a process that can take up to three days and leave the chicks dehydrated and malnourished. Additionally, Bell & Evans invested in state-of-the-art chick trailers to transport chicks from the Hatchery to the farms in the same baskets as they hatched with access to the organic feed during the short drive. Bell & Evans also eliminated the traditional use of machinery handling of chicks at its Hatchery, such as belt drops, shell separators and chick counters. Bell & Evans’ Humane Animal Welfare Standards are the most comprehensive in the industry, beginning at hatch and continuing through the end of the life cycle, with a priority to minimize stress on the birds.”|Bell & Evans (Farmer's Pride)^_

1|30|Chicken, turkey|Oregon, Washington|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Store brands include poultry products that have been privately labeled by grocery chains. Typically, these businesses buy products wholesale and then market those finished or packaged products with their own labels. The inherent problem with private labels is that they lack transparency.
