They write: “Country Choice Organic was founded in 1995 with the notion to make it easier for people to eat organic. Although organic products were available back then, they were harder to find, expensive and most importantly, not very tasty. Having that in mind, the founders of Country Choice set out to provide organic food products that people could enjoy and feel good about choosing without having compromise on taste. By providing only certfied organic products with the finest of ingredients, Country Choice Organic has become a leader in the organic foods industry. The popular oatmeal, snacks and cookies are great-tasting and are made with a minimum of 95% organic ingredients, qualifying for the USDA Organic seal. The company is founded on the idea of providing tasty and nutritious organic treats, while being responsible about how certain ingredients and farming processes affect the Earth at large. Committed to the environmental benefits of sustainable agriculture and organic farming practices. Recognizes and supports the family farm as an important cultural and business asset that should be protected as a chosen lifestyle.

With the same motherly care, applying the highest organic standards, we craft our granola and muesli today. Our customers and their families deserve to put on their table the same quality as our family does. We firmly believe that organic food is the only food in its natural state; unadulterated, nourishing and delicious! One of our goals as a company is to offer only the best and most nutritious foods. That means we are selecting very carefully our organic ingredients not only for delicious taste, but also for their nutrients. We have rejected using oils (e.g. canola) and refined sweeteners, present in the majority of granolas and mueslis in the market. Main source of sweetness are the dry organic fruits in abundance in all Ambrosial Granola & Muesli flavors. We are very proud that Prevention recognized our quality and voted us as the Healthiest Cereal 2011. In addition to the health benefits, we also believe that good food begins with environmentally sustainable farming, that is organic farming. Organic food is not only better for the environment, and the people’s tables, but also supports small family operations and helps the family farm and the rural community survive. If we all remember the old Native American saying that “we don’t inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children”, we will intensify our efforts to protect it and leave it better than we found it.”|Ambrosial^_

Mr. Coltrin found that he enjoyed the flaxseed sprinkled on the whole-wheat flakes that he ate for breakfast. In fact, he liked the combination so much that he decided to package it. And, since he was so proud of his resemblance to our nation’s Uncle Sam character, he named his new cereal Uncle Sam. Attune was acquired by Post Foods in 2013, which is in turn a property of Ralcorp Holdings. Uncle Sam has been an American Original for over 100 years. We take hard red winter wheat berries from the American heartland and then steam, roll and toast them.

One of the brands is Three Sisters, a non-organic “natural” cereal brand, which recently became available exclusively in Whole Foods Stores. Just as Kashi does not state it is owned by Kellogg, the Mom’s Best brand seems to hide that it is a Malt-O-Meal brand. The Mom’s Best website states: “Our company has been owned by the same family for four generations.

The name Kellogg, however, does not appear anywhere on Kashi cereal boxes and appears only once (inconspicuously) on the Kashi website. Kellogg acquired the Kashi brand in 2000, but the Kashi website continues to paint a picture of being a small company: “We are a small (after 25 years, still fewer than 70 of us) band of passionate people.” While Kashi offers some certified organic breakfast cereal options, the vast majority of its products are conventionally produced foods labeled “natural.” The company does not have a commitment to prohibit or avoid genetically engineered ingredients in its “natural” products.

Bear Naked was founded, like many other granola companies, by young entrepeneurs with a successful granola recipe and a home kitchen. Bear Naked never was organic, but Kellogg markets the brand as “100% pure and natural” despite no policy against the use of toxic pesticides, hexane, and genetically engineered ingredients. The Bear Naked website’s “about us” story is long and detailed, yet fails to mention the acquisition by Kellogg in 2007. In fact, the name “Kellogg” appears nowhere on Bear Naked packages or the Bear Naked website. The Bear Naked brand still relies heavily on its image as an up-and-coming start-up by two young entrepreneurs, actively hiding from customers that it became a Kellogg’s brand when the two co-founders sold the brand to the multinational corporation for $60 million in 2007.|Bear Naked^_
