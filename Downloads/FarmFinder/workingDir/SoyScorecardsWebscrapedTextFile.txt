5|955|soymilk, soybeans, tofu, miso, soy sauce, ponzu|Nationwide and International|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Eden Foods readily shared contact information for the farmers who grow organic soybeans for their EdenSoy (soymilk) products. Based on our follow up research, we have no reason to question their claim that all soybeans used in their EdenSoy products come from American farmers with whom they have long-term and stable relationships. The farmers whom we contacted are dedicated to organic principles, and very much appreciate Eden Foods’ commitment to supporting their diverse organic farms. Eden Foods does carry four products that do not contain USA-grown soybeans; these are traditional Japanese specialty products, imported from Japan. The four products containing non-USA grown soybeans are: Natto Miso, freeze-dried tofu, Tekka sauce and Ponzu sauce. We appreciate Eden Foods’ honesty in sharing with us that these four products contain soybeans that are not USA-grown. Eden Foods rates very highly because, in addition to sourcing only USA-grown soybeans for their soymilk, they test every incoming load of soybeans for GMO contamination and use only pure food ingredients for flavoring (e.g. using real vanilla extract instead of natural flavors). Note: consumers may wonder why Eden Foods products do not carry the green USDA Organic seal. Eden Foods explains: “Although all EDEN organic food is grown, handled, processed, and certified in a way that meets and exceeds the requirements for using the ‘USDA Organic’ seal, Eden chooses not to use this seal on its food labels. In short, this seal does not approach Eden’s standards for organic, in practice or in spirit.” Eden Foods writes: “We are an independent natural food company offering authentic organic family farm food since 1968. Dedicated farmers nurture more than 75,000 acres. Each food is prepared as if for our children, with no irradiation, no preservatives, no chemical additives, no food colorings, no refined sugars, and no genetically engineered ingredients – just the best that can be found. EDENSOY is 100 percent USA family farm organic soybeans and grain. We visit each farm, the fields, and families regularly. Ingenious tending over decades provides vital soil producing food that brims with energy, flavor, and vastly superior nutrition. Soy protein requires thorough cooking to transform it into easy to assimilate food. EDENSOY is made at our certified organic plant employing 240 continuous quality control checks and decades of research on how best to choose and prepare soybeans. From double reverse osmosis purified water, to a patented enzyme invalidator, to Swedish aseptic packaging, every step contributes to greater value. Only the finest food goes into EDENSOY, even the vanilla beans.“|Eden Foods^_

Twin Oaks Community Foods is a wonderful example of a brand connected directly to the hard-working farmers who produce food. They write: “Twin Oaks Community Foods is a worker-owned co-operative located on 400 acres in central Virginia. We have been in business producing quality Organic Extra-firm Tofu since 1991. Our co-operative began by providing easy-to-use meat alternatives to Charlottesville, Richmond and local vegetarian communities.

Although they carry some products that are not certified organic, they use organic soybeans in all their products. Fresh Tofu imports a high-quality, non-synthetic nigari coagulant from Japan. They also use tofu for their veggie burgers, which means they are one of the few companies offering veggie burgers that do not contain hexane-extracted soy protein. Fresh Tofu products are an excellent choice for consumers looking for vegetarian foods made with high-quality ingredients that are not chemically processed. Fresh Tofu writes: “The principle “Fresher is Better” has guided Fresh Tofu Inc. in supplying a regional marketplace with locally produced, artisan quality, Organic Tofu and Soyfood products since 1983. Hands-on techniques and quality ingredients have earned Fresh Tofu Inc. its gold standard reputation. Fresh Tofu Inc. has direct longstanding relationships with small organic farmers in the finger Lakes Region of N.Y. State. Organic Soybeans are grown in the fertile glacial soils of the region specially for Fresh Tofu Inc.

The store contracts with a manufacturer to produce the private label foods, and often the manufacturer relies on additional middlemen. Tracing the soybeans to the source is therefore often a difficult endeavor. Direct relationships between the brand and organic farmers are nonexistent. By virtue of the fact that these companies are operating in a secretive manner, consumers should be very dubious in terms of the quality and sourcing of their raw materials.
