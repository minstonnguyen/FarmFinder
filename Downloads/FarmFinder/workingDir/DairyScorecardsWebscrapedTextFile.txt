Its connection with the marketplace truly exemplifies the organic ideal. They write: “Radiance Dairy is an organic, grass-based dairy located near Fairfield, Iowa, with on-farm processing facilities in which cream-line milk (whole, 2%, and skim), whipping cream, yogurt, and cheese are produced. All of the products made on the farm are sold locally through three grocery stores and about twenty restaurants in Fairfield. All of our dairy products are sold within a five-mile radius of the farm. All milk produced on the farm is processed by Radiance Dairy, and no milk is brought onto the farm from other dairies. Radiance Dairy began in 1980 with two cows. Over the years it has grown to the current milking herd of 90 cows. Owned by Francis and Susan Thicke, it is operated by them and several employees.” For more information on Radiance Dairy, see ourfarmer spotlight.

They write: “We grow all of the food for the cows on our nearly 420 acre certified organic farm in Teton Valley, Idaho, including pasture, hay, and barley. Only rarely are off-farm inputs required; when things like extra bedding are needed, they are sourced locally from another organic farm. Our irrigation water emerges in the form of Paradise Springs, from the bottom of a hillside adjacent to thousands of acres of National Forest and is pure enough to drink right out of the spring. Every effort has been made to retain nature’s purity and goodness and to block out the constant increase of radiation and chemicals in the environment.

We started “Working Cows Dairy” in October 1985. We milked 180 cows for a dairy farmer in Cottondale Florida and for that we could use his barn and 40 acres. We leased 55 cows, with the $5,000 we had saved in Holland, and started milking about 20 hours a day. In the spring of 1986 Jan planted watermelons on part of the land and had a fruit stand on Hwy 231. We stayed on this place for 2 years and left with 29 cows to a rented place in Grand-Ridge Florida. There we had three boys Jonny, Mendy, and Ike. We worked our way up from 29 cows to 220 cows four years later. We moved again to the place we are now located in June 1991. We do not homogenize our milk so the cream still comes to the top.  We sell Whole, 2%, 1%, and Fat Free all in gallons and half gallons.  We have half gallons of cream and chocolate milk too.

5|1580|Fluid milk, yogurt, cheese|NY|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|Chaseholm Farm is a sibling effort in family farming. Sarah manages the dairy herd and their grazing lands, while Rory turns the milk the cows produce into delicious cheeses. We are third generation farmers whose relationship to the land is built on principles of sustainable agriculture. Sarah had been involved with the day to day operations on this farm since childhood and took over in her own right in March of 2013. It was then that she began the years long process of transitioning the farm to organic management and grass based production. The principles of grass farming require that the farm system be thought about in a holistic way. We work to create active and healthy soil microbiology so that soil can support healthy plants that can be grazed by cows. How do we assist in creating active soil microbiology? By grazing cows! It’s a complex and also delightfully simple cycle (no herbicides, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers!). Sarah stopped feeding grain in 2015. The farm was certified Organic and 100% Grass-Fed in 2017. The original motivation for raising dairy animals on an all-grass diet was to try and reduce inputs and longterm expense. With each transition season, Sarah’s perspective has deepened into an appreciation of the complex management puzzle grassfed farming presents – and the lifetime of learning – in front of her. She is working towards selecting for bovine genetics compatible with her management system and the building of vibrant, productive soils. The farm is guided by Holistic Management decision making principles in both farm system and business management. For more information on Chaseholm Farm, see ourfarmer spotlight.

Since 1975, during our first days as homesteaders with just a family cow, we have made our yogurt right here on the farm. We use only our own milk to produce this delicious yogurt. Our soils are sweet and mineralized. The extra special “nutty” flavor of our whole yogurt begins with the land we farm.” Butterworks Farm products can be found at co-ops, health food stores, smaller grocery markets and a few chain stores near their farm location in Vermont and neighboring New Hampshire.

Other than incidental part time help, the family makes Thistle Hill Farm Tarentaise from the ground up. Every aspect of creating the cheese, from caring for the hay fields and pastures, bringing in the hay and caring for and milking the Jersey dairy cows is done on the farm by the Putnam family. The closed herd of certified organic Jersey cows are fed only certified organic hay produced by the farm and certified organic grain. In the summer the cows are rotated through a series of small pastures to ensure that they are on new fresh grass every twelve hours. The barn contains comfort tie stalls where the cows are milked twice per day. During the summer, except during severe weather, the cows are never in the barn except for milking and their morning nap.

Larson Farm has been in business since June 1976 when we operated as a conventional dairy farm. Cynthia and Rich received production and milk quality awards, and were named Outstanding Young Farmers of the Year in 1985. The herd peaked at 150 milkers, but due to declining milk prices and shrinking profit margin, the conventional dairy operation was closed in 1993. The farm has since operated on a much smaller scale. In 2007 the dairy was reactivated with four Jersey cows, selling ‘raw’ unpasteurized milk to friends and neighbors who appreciate the flavor and nutritional benefits of truly fresh milk. As demand for quality products increased, we added to the dairy herd and invested in soil improvement, became USDA-certified Organic, and PCO-certified 100% Grass-Fed.

5|1450|Yogurt, fluid milk|New England and New York|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|They write: “A farm, by definition, is a departure from nature — it is land taken from its wild state and turned to human ends. But it is possible for a farm to learn from natural systems, to work with mother nature and integrate her patterns. This is the soul of organic agriculture; it is also a practical way to produce high quality food while building soil and conserving the habitat and biodiversity that come with well-managed open land. No farm will ever approach the ecological sophistication of nature, because the balance of activity is focused on the needs of our one species. But that doesn’t mean we can’t take good care — and a little better care every year, as we learn, and learn. This is organics at its best — good stewardship of the various communities that overlap to create a farm. At Sidehill Farm, we are constantly improving our systems, so that they flow more directly from the examples we see in nature. We resist quick fixes like antibiotics and organically approved pesticides that ameliorate short-term problems while hiding or creating deeper issues. We select for plants and animals that balance productivity with ruggedness and adaptability. We work with and foster the various micro-climates found on our farm. We are mildly obsessed with soil and the density of life within it. We select and develop technologies that respect natural systems and use energy efficiently. And we are amazed at how much better we can always do, how much we have to learn. Sidehill Farm Yogurt is certified organic by Baystate Organic Certifiers, but that is the short version of a longer answer. For a long time, we joked that we would never certify the food we produce because the National Organic Program isn‘t strict enough to acknowledge how we farm. More seriously, we believe that farming organically is a management decision; but certifying organic is a marketing decision. We are blessed with local customers who enjoy our food and know us by name and face. They know they are welcome to stop by the farm anytime, and observe our management practices. They have given us one of the most precious things a farm can earn from it‘s customers: their trust.”|Sidehill Farm^_

I was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria – a crossroad of many ethnic cultures and religions. And a city older than some of the oldest cities in the world: Rome, Athens, and Constantinople. In 342 BC, Plovdiv was conquered by Philip II of Macedon (father of Alexander the Great) and it was named Philipopolis. During the Roman invasion in the middle of 1st century AD, Philipopolis became part of the Roman Empire and was renamed Trimontium (The City of the Three Hills). In the last century, the most popular hotel-restaurant in Plovdiv was named Trimontium and became a symbol of the city. The citizens of Plovdiv gave it the nickname, “Trimona”. Whether it’s a budding rock band practicing in their garage, a writer scribbling her tale on some napkins, or an artist sketching his masterpiece on some old notebooks, our story is no different. It all began late at night in my cramped kitchen. I remember waking up my wife in the middle of the night and asking her to taste the last batch that just came out, holding a spoon of yogurt before her half-asleep face. Despite the sleepless nights and failures, there was some indescribable excitement about making yogurt in my kitchen. I was absolutely passionate about it and there was no stopping me. Those first steps were followed by a two-year transition from that tiny kitchen to our creamery. We incorporated the peacock feather motif, a pattern used in the traditional Bulgarian pottery in our label design. Centuries ago, yogurt was made and served in these beautifully decorated ceramic bowls. We want to preserve that history and continue the tradition by using it on our very own cups. We are confident in three things:1) Cows should eat grass2) We whole-heartedly love yogurt3) With this whole-hearted love, we believe that yogurtshould be made from whole milk We do not strain our yogurt and we keep the healthy whey. Nothing is removed and nothing is added. This is what we call natural and that’s how our Bulgarian yogurt was born in New York. Yogurt is a huge part of the Bulgarian culture. It is the most popular food as it is used in many recipes and healing remedies. In the Bulgarian language it is called “kiselo mliak”? which translates to “sour milk”. That?s why the original yogurt is tangy and tart in its flavor. Just like a good wine that needs to age in an oak barrel to bring out the best of its flavor, this tangy and tart flavor is the required proof of the quality of the yogurt.”|Trimona Yogurt^_

Our products are also pasteurized at low temperatures to preserve the farm fresh flavor. The milk used in Kalona SuperNatural products comes from small, sustainable Amish and Mennonite farms with average herds of 35 cows. Our producers know that cows do best when they can harvest their own feed from the pastures around them. Unlike larger companies, we know each and every farmer we work with. We visit their land. We know their families. We understand how and why they created their product.

Humboldt county provides an exceptional home for dairy cows because the temperate climate and frequent fog keep pastures lush and green year-round.  The temperature varies only about 12 degrees from winter to summer, which means our cows are comfortable in their thick coats all year long.  And since we’re right along the coast, the fresh ocean breezes create some of the finest air quality around.  Repeated flooding from the rivers in the area and run-off from the coastal mountains deposit minerals, mulch, clay, and silt into the soil, creating the ideal environment for growing grasses.  Our farmers support this rich, fertile soil through careful pasture management, working with the biology of the soil and adding organic compost to replace nutrients that are taken out.

Our chief science advisor Dr. Greg Thoma, a faculty member at Colorado State University, advises us in calculating each of Neutral’s product footprints. Dr. Thoma has dedicated the past 12 years to quantifying the carbon footprint of U.S. dairy, including a groundbreaking study of the emissions associated with consumption of a gallon of milk based on data from more than 500 American dairy farms. We work with farmers to sponsor projects that profoundly reduce their overall footprint. These changes benefit local and global ecosystems by keeping methane and other pollutants out of the atmosphere. And because Neutral makes capital investments on farms, we’re helping farmers tackle projects they have been wanting to do—in some cases for years—but have not yet been able to because of money, time, and risk. Reduction opportunities include improved forage production and grazing management, nutrient and manure management, and conservation practices, such as reducing tillage or planting cover crops. Neutral’s Head of Carbon Reduction, ex-NASA-funded climate scientist from a ranching family, Ann Radil, leads this effort. Finally, as our reduction efforts are a work in progress, we guarantee that every product is 100% carbon neutral by investing in carbon offsets from dairy projects across the country. Pioneering dairy farmers are turning cow manure into renewable energy right on the farm—and in doing so, are significantly reducing the amount of methane emissions along the way. We know not all offsets are created equal. Neutral only acquires offsets from U.S. dairy farmers that are verified by Climate Action Reserve (CAR),  American Carbon Registry, and VERRA. Verifying our offsets through accredited auditors ensures the projects we support are real, additional, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable.

Traditional farming methods are maintained for two reasons. First, we want to remain good stewards of our precious land. Second, we believe there is no better way to instill core family values that raising our children on working farms that grow food for the community around us. Our farms grow most of their own animal feed, redistribute animal waste as earth-friendly fertilizers, and naturally control pests and weeds. Fields are cultivated with horse-drawn plows so we can constantly monitor the health or our land and crops- an impossibility when sitting atop a massive tractor. Hence, we don’t need to rely on harmful chemicals to discourage weeds and pests. In short, each farm is a small ecosystem that promotes natural ways for plants, animals and soils to thrive. Many of the farming techniques we use today date back to the 1600s from our Swiss and German forefathers. It all starts with our appreciation of livestock manure. While many think manure is a waste product, we know there is not a better, safer fertilized ever invented. And it’s free! We annually rotate our crops and use lime to sweeten the soils. Legumes are planted to naturally extract nitrogen from air and convert it to plant food. We produce an abundance of hay that is stored so our animals are well-nourished throughout the winter. And, of course, our livestock, cows, chickens, pigs, and goats provide more manure that re-starts the growing process.”|Green Field Farms^_

Today, what sets Clover apart is its innovative approach to the dairy business. As the first dairy processor to elevate milk from a commodity to a specialty food, Clover established the Clover Promise of Excellence (formerly known as the North Coast Excellence Certified program) — setting some of the most rigorous standards in the dairy industry which far surpass those of the state and federal governments. As part of this standard of excellence, Clover cows are raised on local family-owned farms that follow sustainable agriculture practices and tend small herds on spacious ranches, where the cows are well-treated and healthy. Clover farms are also American Humane Certified and must demonstrate environmental consciousness and stewardship of land. In fact, they was the first dairy company in the United States to become American Humane Certified and helped write the standards on animal welfare. They also made an early entrance into organics to provide support and help fuel the movement. Clover Sonoma’s passion for supporting small family farms, animal welfare, sustainable business practices, and community have always been the hallmarks of the business, which has helped them earn a Certified B Corporation® title.

Unfortunately, they have failed to update some of their information needed for this more comprehensive scorecard. Since we were unable to confirm some of the information this brand has been downgraded by one whole classification. Where possible, this brand’s old scores, based on their previous survey and our confirmation work, were substituted into the new rubric to represent this change. In dairy, we now see about half of the “organic” milk supply coming from factory dairies milking their cows as many as three to four times a day pushing for high production (legitimate organic farms usually milk twice a day). Cornucopia’s research also shows many of these dairies are still not providing the required amount of grazing for each cow as the law requires. While some excellent dairy marketers may feel they don’t need to participate because they already have a good relationship with their consumers, their lack of participation aids and abets factory farms and hurts ethical dairies across the country (many of whom do not have the option to directly market to consumers and need to rely on the wholesale marketplace). Participation in this survey and scorecard separates the organic label between those brands that are ”beyond organic,” others at least meeting the minimum legal standards and those that are ethically deficient. In an industry where industrial dairies do have something to hide, the lack of transparency in brands that might otherwise score well hurts the integrity of the organic label.

In 2021, Danone NA announced that it would be terminating 89 milk contracts with its Horizon brand farmers in the Northeast. Many of the affected farm families have been providing organic milk to Horizon Organic for decades and have been instrumental to the brand’s success. When Danone NA dropped small Horizon brand dairies in the Northeast, they reduced the value of the milk in Horizon cartons. More Horizon milk now comes from “organic” factory dairies in arid regions, and it offers fewer nutrients, poor animal welfare, and highwater use. We recommend you try to find another source for your organic milk. Several 4 cow-brands on our Organic Dairy Scorecard are available nationwide.
